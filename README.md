# Instagram Clone with React and Tailwind CSS

## Objective

Build an Instagram-like feed using React, Vite and Tailwind CSS, where users can browse posts, view individual post pages, and visit user profiles.

### Requirements

1. **Home Page (Feed)**:
   - Create a grid layout for posts, similar to Instagram's feed.
   - Each post should be clickable, leading to a detailed post page.

2. **Post Page**:
   - Display the selected post in detail.
   - Include a button or link to navigate back to the feed.

3. **User Profile Page**:
   - Display the user’s profile information in a header (e.g., avatar, bio, number of posts).
   - Below the header, show a grid of the user's posts.
   - Clicking on any post should take the user to the post's detail page.

4. **404 Page**:
   - Implement a custom 404 page that appears for any non-existent routes.

### Tips

- Responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile.
- Use React Router to manage the different routes (Feed, Post, Profile, and 404 pages).

### Resources

- Use this JSON file to populate your feed with posts: [instagram sample](https://gist.github.com/mgcm/4d4ddf687b1399b87de4)
